This was a single labelling problem as part of my Machine Learning course in my third year of uni.
The goal was to classify the rating of movies on IMDB by certain properties, using many different classifiers.

The following was used:
- Bagging and voting
- Decision Trees
- KNN
- Logistic Regression
- Random Forest
- SVC
- Stacking


1) the following perquisite packages are required to run this solution:
	cpi
	imblearn
	sklearn
	numpy
	pandas
	os
you likely have all of these except cpi, but all can be installed via pip.

2) To obtain all results from this program, simply run from main. this will generate all plots and all csvs. 

3) the results directory contains all results currently, but will be safely overwritten should you run the program.
